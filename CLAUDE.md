# wow-two-sdk-beta.events

Shared event catalog fed by SCFD and curated in review, with private tracking per organization — as a .NET package family, an npm package and a service image, under one contract.

## Lazy loading

- Do NOT pre-read files at conversation start; open a file only when the task needs it.
- `.claude/rules/file-references.md` is a lookup table, not a reading list.
- Navigate code under `engineering/codebase/` with `tree`/`find`/`grep` — it is not listed in references.

## Structure

```
product/                 ← the capability (no code): product · context · features · flows · brand
engineering/             ← the HOW
├── architecture/        ← architecture · contract · package-registry · decisions/ · flows/
├── development/         ← this repo's dev guidelines (defer to wow-two-ws/conventions/)
├── planning/            ← backlog.md + version-track/v{X.Y}/ (newest = active; drives the image version only)
├── deployment/          ← deploy.yml · Dockerfile · docker-compose.yml · deployment.md
├── research/ · scripts/ ← analyses · release helpers publish-packages.yml calls
└── codebase/            ← THE CODE — only place code lives
    ├── events.backend-services/    ← Events.BackendServices.slnx: packages/{Abstractions,Module,Client,Testing} · service/Events.Api · tests/Events.Tests.*
    └── events.frontend-services/   ← pnpm workspace: packages/fe-events (npm: contracts · kit · admin) · apps/web (hosted pages + console)
```

## Rules

- Shape: wow-two-ws/conventions/development/repo/structure/domain-structure.md; repo-specific deltas only in `engineering/development/`.
- The contract lives in `packages/Abstractions`; Module (Form 1) and Client (Forms 2/3) implement it, and
  `Events.Tests.Conformance` runs the one suite (`GreetingsBrokerConformance`, in `packages/Testing`) against both.
- A package references only what its layer row allows; the service takes the packages by `ProjectReference` and adds
  only hosting, the HTTP mirror of the contract and the hosted pages.
- Management screens ship in `fe-events`'s `./admin` export; `apps/web`'s console composes them and builds none itself.
- Package versions come from tags (`be-v*` NuGet, `fe-v*` npm) in `publish-packages.yml`; never commit a version,
  never create a GitHub Release for a package tag. The image version comes from the version track (`v*`).
- Core is pinned (`BackendSdkVersion`, the exact `@wow-two-beta/fe`); a needed core change goes to core first, then the
  pin moves here. `core-latest.yml` tests the newest core nightly; a red run is a fix here, not a gate.
- The store is PostgreSQL. Schema changes are `packages/Module/Migrations/NNN-name/{Apply,Rollback}.sql` pairs of the
  module's named set `events` (schema `events`); never edit an applied one. A deploy applies them with the image's
  `migrate` verb before the release serves; only a local run applies them at boot.
- The backend build runs the frontend build (`BuildSpa`), so it needs Node and pnpm; every tier but unit needs Docker
  (PostgreSQL through Testcontainers).
- Repository creation, GitHub settings, rollout state and hand steps: `engineering/development/development.md`
