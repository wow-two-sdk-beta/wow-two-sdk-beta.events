# wow-two-sdk-beta.events

Internal event catalog fed by SCFD and curated in review, with private tracking per organization — as a .NET package family, an npm package and a service image, under one contract. Sourced records serve internal tracking only and are never republished.

> **Pre-release.** Published to NuGet (`WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.*`), npm (`@wow-two-beta/fe-events`) and as the image of each GitHub Release (`v*`); running on Wheelhouse `events-dev`. Plan: `engineering/planning/version-track/v0.1/`.

## Artifacts

| Artifact | Registry | Line · tag | Install |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Abstractions` — the contract | nuget.org | `10.y.z-beta` · `be-v*` | `dotnet add package WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Abstractions --prerelease` |
| `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Module` — Form 1, in process | nuget.org | `10.y.z-beta` · `be-v*` | `dotnet add package WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Module --prerelease` |
| `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Client` — Forms 2 and 3, over HTTP | nuget.org | `10.y.z-beta` · `be-v*` | `dotnet add package WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Client --prerelease` |
| `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Testing` — fake and conformance suite | nuget.org | `10.y.z-beta` · `be-v*` | `dotnet add package WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Events.Testing --prerelease` |
| `@wow-two-beta/fe-events` — contract mirror, widget, forward, admin panels | npm | `0.0.z` · `fe-v*` | `pnpm add @wow-two-beta/fe-events` |
| `events` service image | GHCR | `X.Y.Z` · `v*` | `ghcr.io/wow-two-sdk-beta/wow-two-sdk-beta.events/events`, deployed by Wheelhouse |

A product pins the family with one `EventsSdkVersion` property beside `BackendSdkVersion`.

## Forms

```csharp
// Form 1 — in process, over the product's own PostgreSQL database; its migrate verbs apply the module's set
services.AddEvents().Configure(options => options.ConnectionString = "...");

// Forms 2 and 3 — over the running Events service; the product's code does not change
services.AddEventsClient(options => options.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://events.example.com/"));
```

## Layout

```
product/                 ← the capability: spec, state, features, flows, brand (no code)
engineering/             ← the how: architecture (contract, package registry), planning, deployment, scripts
└── codebase/
    ├── events.backend-services/    ← packages/ (the NuGet family) · service/Events.Api · tests/
    └── events.frontend-services/   ← packages/fe-events (npm) · apps/web (hosted pages + console)
```

## Run it (dev)

```bash
# Database: the compose file's local PostgreSQL (port in engineering/deployment/deployment.md); appsettings.Local.json
# (gitignored) points the service at it, read because the https launch profile sets LOCAL_SETTINGS=true. A local run
# applies pending migrations at boot.
docker compose -f engineering/deployment/docker-compose.yml up -d database

# Service
cd engineering/codebase/events.backend-services && dotnet run --project service/Events.Api --launch-profile https

# Pages and console, proxied to the service
cd engineering/codebase/events.frontend-services && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm dev
```

## Test it

```bash
# Backend: unit, integration, E2E, conformance and migrations tiers; all but unit run PostgreSQL in Docker
# (Testcontainers), and the build also builds the frontend workspace, so Node and pnpm are required
cd engineering/codebase/events.backend-services && dotnet test Events.BackendServices.slnx

# Frontend: lint, tests (builds fe-events first), production build, packed-consumer check
cd engineering/codebase/events.frontend-services && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm check:package

# Release scripts: the tag version logic
bash engineering/scripts/test-next-version.sh
```
